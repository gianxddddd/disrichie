<h1 align="center">Disrichie</h1>

A simple program to display custom Rich Presence on Discord!

# Introduction
## So, what the hell does this do?
Basically, it displays a custom Rich Presence status on your Discord account, don't worry it's not affiliated with Discord Inc.

## Will I get banned from Discord when I use this?
No, it does not violate Discord's Terms of Service. It's not like you're modifying the Discord webapp itself.

## How do I get started?
If you wanna check it out immediately, go to the [Releases](https://github.com/gianxddddd/disrichie/releases) page.

or, just do `git clone` for this repo then execute `python disrichie` (This does not build the standalone version, but rather runs disrichie from your Python interpreter)

or or or, if you want the harder way that you want to smash and cry if you fail multiple times but with the most updated code, then proceed to Building section below this.

# Building
Wanna build the standalone version for yourself so that you cry when you fail multiple times? Let's go!

## Requirements
Disrichie requires the latest version of Python (or Python 3.10 at least) with the pip package manager.

And, if you don't have the required modules/packages installed, you can execute `tools/setupenv.cmd`

## The Final Instruction
Now, this could be very easy, execute this command:

```shell
$ ./tools/pack # You must be on the source directory to execute this, otherwise it'll fail!
```

To finally build the standalone version of Disrichie.

If that fails, you must go with the `python disrichie` stuff, sorry m8.

# Distributing
Ayo, you want to distribute your standalone version of Disrichie? Contact me at Discord: `GianXD#1059` so that I could add it!

# FAQ
## UNIX support? (e.g Linux, macOS, FreeBSD)
Maybe soon, but I'm very busy and lazy to port Disrichie on another operating system.

If you managed to port it successfully, maybe I can put it on the releases page and I'll take you credit for making it possible.

## Why is this written in Python? Don't you write programs in C/C++ before?
Since I moved back to Windows 10 (or shall i say binbows 10 haha got em), It was so hard to setup a C/C++ workspace and I don't have time to choose whether I should use Visual Studio or MSYS2.

## Where can I contact the author?
You can either send a mail on `borcillofg2020@gmail.com` or chat in Discord: `GianXD#1059`
